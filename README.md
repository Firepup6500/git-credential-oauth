git-credential-oauth
====================

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/hickford/git-credential-oauth.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hickford/git-credential-oauth)

*No more passwords! No more personal access tokens! No more SSH keys!*

A Git credential helper that securely authenticates to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket and other forges using [OAuth](https://oauth.net/).

The first time you push, the helper will open a browser window to authenticate. Subsequent pushes within the cache timeout require no interaction.

## Motivation

Two-factor authentication changed how users authenticate to websites, but Git still assumes users can type a password from memory. Personal access tokens are easy enough to copy and paste but awkward to store securely. [git-credential-cache](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential-cache) works well for passwords but not personal access tokens because the token is lost when the cache expires. All in all, the usability is so poor that the [most popular advice on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35942890/284795) is to insecurely save credentials in plaintext.

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/hickford/git-credential-oauth/releases

Alternatively, Go users can install to `~/go/bin` with:

	go install github.com/hickford/git-credential-oauth@latest

Test that Git can find the binary:

	git credential-oauth

If you have problems, make sure that the binary is [located in the path](https://superuser.com/a/284351/62691) and executable.

## Configuration

Git is cleverly designed to [support multiple credential helpers](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials#_custom_helpers). To fill credentials, Git calls each helper in turn until it has the information it needs. git-credential-oauth is a read-only credential-generating helper, designed to be used in combination with a storage helper.  

To use together with [git-credential-cache](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential-cache):

```sh
git config --global --unset-all credential.helper
git config --global --add credential.helper "cache --timeout 7200" # two hours
git config --global --add credential.helper oauth
```

You may choose a different storage helper such as `osxkeychain` or `wincred`, but git-credential-oauth must be configured last. This ensures Git checks for *stored* credentials before generating *new* credentials.

### Manual config

Edit your [global git config](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#FILES) `~/.gitconfig` to include the following lines:

```ini
[credential]
	helper = cache --timeout 7200	# two hours
	helper = oauth
```

### Unconfiguration

Edit `~/.gitconfig` manually, or:

	git config --global --unset-all credential.helper oauth

## Philosophy

* Do one thing well, namely OAuth authentication.
* Interoperate with other credential helpers.
* Contribute upstream to improve the ecosystem.

## Comparison with Git Credential Manager

[Git Credential Manager](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager) has broader functionality including storage. However because it's developed in .NET, GCM is harder to build and install on Linux. In particular, GCM is awkward for Linux distributions to package.

Disclaimer: I also contribute to GCM.

## Development

Install locally with `go install .`.

### Debugging

Use the `-verbose` flag to print more details:

```sh
git config --global --unset-all credential.helper oauth
git config --global --add credential.helper "oauth -verbose"
```

You can also test git-credential-oauth in isolation:

```
echo host=gitlab.com\nprotocol=https | git-credential-oauth -verbose get
```

You can test configured helpers in combination with `git credential fill`, eg.

```
echo url=https://gitlab.com | git credential fill
```

To see which helpers Git calls, set `export GIT_TRACE=1`.
